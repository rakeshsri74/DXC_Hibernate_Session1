Hibernate Architecture:

For creating first hibernate application we must know the elements of Hibernate architecture.
They are as follows:
	1.SessionFactory:It hold second level cache(Optional)
	2.Session:It holds first level cache.Provides the method to insert,update,delete and retrive the data.
		save()
		get()If you are not sure that a matching row exists.Returns null if no matching row
		load() It throws ObjectNotFound Exception if there is no database matching rows and no database hit 		occurs with load.
		update()
		saveOrUpdate()
		flush():Synchronize database with persistence context.Occurs automatically upon transaction commit.
		delete()
	3.Transaction-Commit,Rollback
